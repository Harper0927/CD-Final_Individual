1,BBC-Gansu2,2023/12/19,Frances Mao & Christy Cooney,Gansu earthquake- Over 120 killed in China's deadliest quake in years,China,China,BBC NEWS,"Gansu earthquake: Over 120 killed in China's deadliest quake in yearsBy Frances Mao & Christy CooneyBBC News 19 December 2023 At least 127 people have been killed in north-west China in the country's deadliest earthquake for years. The 6.2 magnitude quake hit mountainous Gansu province around midnight on Monday (16:00 GMT), also shaking neighbouring Qinghai. Fatalities may rise, with more than 700 reported injured in icy conditions. Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered thousands of rescue crew to the region, among the poorest and most diverse in China. The earthquake is the country's deadliest since 2014, when more than 600 people were killed by a quake in south-western Yunnan province. On Tuesday, footage shown on state TV and social media networks showed entire villages split by the quake, as well as collapsed buildings and houses. Residents who fled their homes were also shown huddling over makeshift fires at hastily erected evacuation camps. Temperatures hit -13C (8.7F) on Tuesday, Chinese media reported. Survivors said the tremors had felt like ""being tossed by surging waves"" and recalled rushing out of their apartments. ""I woke my family up and we rushed down all 16 floors in one breath,"" said one man named Mr Qin by Chinese outlets. Local officials in Jishishan county, the worst-hit in Gansu province, said more than 5,000 buildings in the area had been damaged. Many other buildings in the province have been hit by mudslides triggered by the quake, while dozens of roads have been damaged by landslides. Chinese media quoted a director of the Gansu rescue team, who attributed the widescale damage to poor building quality in the villages - many homes being old and made of clay. Gansu lies between the Tibetan and Loess plateaus and borders Mongolia. The remote region is one of China's poorest and most ethnically diverse. The epicentre of the quake was in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, home to many Chinese Muslim groups, including the Hui, Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar people. Chinese authorities said the quake measured 6.2 on the Richter scale, while the US Geological Survey (USGS) recorded a magnitude of 5.9 and depth of 10km (6 miles). About 10 aftershocks have taken place, local authorities reported. On Tuesday, Xinjiang, the province west of Gansu, also recorded a 5.5 magnitude quake - but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Across the region, power and water supplies have been disrupted, hindering rescue efforts. Officials say they have limited time left to rescue people in the sub-zero conditions. ""It is too cold to bear... it's -15C [here],"" Wang Yi, chief commander of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, told the BBC. Blue Sky is China's largest non-governmental humanitarian organisation, with more than 30,000 volunteers across the country. Mr Wang said he expected the number of casualties to climb. ""We now need to dig deeper [into the rubble]. But there are no big buildings in the area. So it will rise, but it won't be much,"" he said. President Xi has said ""all efforts should be made to carry out search and rescue, treat the injured in a timely manner, and minimise casualties"". China sits in a region where a number of tectonic plates - notably the Eurasian, Indian and Pacific plates - meet. It is particularly prone to earthquakes. An earthquake in Yushu in Qinghai province, which is next to Gansu, claimed almost 2,700 lives in 2010.

2,BBC-Gansu3,2023/12/20,Frances Mao,Gansu earthquake- Authorities nearing end of rescues as more than 130 killed,China,China,BBC NEWS,"Gansu earthquake: Authorities nearing end of rescues as more than 130 killed By Frances Mao BBC News 20 December 2023 Rescue efforts for survivors of an earthquake that killed at least 131 in China's north-west are coming to an end. Authorities on Wednesday said they were wrapping up operations and would now focus on treating the injured and helping those who lost their homes. The 6.2 magnitude quake hit Gansu province Monday night, injuring nearly 1,000 in the mountainous region. Thousands of workers have been operating in sub-zero temperatures. Temperatures hit -13C (8.7F) on Tuesday, Chinese media reported. Large parts of northern China are caught in a cold snap, with many cities reporting record low temperatures. Sixteen people remain missing in neighbouring Qinghai province, to the south of Gansu. Local officials in Jishishan county, the worst-hit in Gansu province, said more than 5,000 buildings in the area had been damaged. Many other buildings in the province were hit by mudslides triggered by the quake, while roads were damaged by landslides. Pictures from the region showed entire villages split by the quake, as well as collapsed buildings and houses. Residents who fled their homes were also shown huddling over makeshift fires at hastily erected evacuation camps. Survivors said the tremors had felt like ""being tossed by surging waves"" and recalled rushing out of their apartments. ""I woke my family up and we rushed down all 16 floors in one breath,"" said one man named Mr Qin by Chinese outlets. Monday's quake was reported as China's deadliest earthquake since 2014, when more than 600 people were killed by a quake in south-western Yunnan province. Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered thousands of firemen, soldiers and policemen, as well as medical personnel, to the region, which is among the poorest and most diverse in China. Gansu lies between the Tibetan and Loess plateaus and borders Mongolia. The remote region is one of China's poorest and most ethnically diverse. The epicentre of the quake was in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, home to many Chinese Muslim groups, including the Hui, Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar people. Chinese authorities said the quake measured 6.2 on the Richter scale, while the US Geological Survey (USGS) recorded a magnitude of 5.9 and depth of 10km (6 miles). Dozens of smaller aftershocks followed the initial quake. Officials also warned of possible tremors with a magnitude of more than 5.0 in the coming days. Officials had told the BBC on Monday they had limited time to rescue people in the sub-zero conditions. ""It is too cold to bear... it's -15C [here],"" Wang Yi, chief commander of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, told the BBC. Blue Sky is China's largest non-governmental humanitarian organisation, with more than 30,000 volunteers across the country. Mr Wang said he expected the number of casualties to climb. ""We now need to dig deeper [into the rubble]. But there are no big buildings in the area. So it will rise, but it won't be much,"" he said. President Xi has said ""all efforts should be made to carry out search and rescue, treat the injured in a timely manner, and minimise casualties"". China sits in a region where a number of tectonic plates - notably the Eurasian, Indian and Pacific plates - meet. It is particularly prone to earthquakes. An earthquake in Yushu in Qinghai province, which is next to Gansu, claimed almost 2,700 lives in 2010.

6,BBC-Janpan3,2024/1/2,Rupert Wingfield-Hayes,What a century of earthquakes has taught Japan,Asia,Japan,BBC NEWS,"What a century of earthquakes has taught Japan By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News 2 January 2024 By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes Former BBC Tokyo correspondent It's been nearly 13 years since the devastating earthquake and tsunami that triggered an accident at a nuclear plant in Fukushima. But memories in Japan are still fresh. And on Monday, all of them will have been brought back in to focus as the shaking began in Ishikawa and the tsunami alarms began sounding. The warnings are not exactly unusual in Japan. When I first moved there, I would leap out of bed at the slightest shaking of our building. But within months, I was sleeping through the tremors. And in Japan, quakes quickly become a part of life. You get used to them, up to a point. There is still always that nagging feeling in the back of your mind. When will the next big one hit? Is our building good enough? For this generation all those fears were realised on 11 March, 2011. For two minutes the earth shook in a way no-one had experienced within living memory. It went on, and on, and on. Anyone who lived through it can recount exactly where they were and how terrified they felt. But worse was to come. Within 40 minutes, the first tsunamis were coming ashore, crashing over sea walls and sweeping away towns and villages for hundreds of kilometres along Japan's north-east coast, all carried on live TV by a news helicopter hovering over the city of Sendai. The following day brought even more terrible news - a nuclear power plant was in crisis. The Fukushima meltdowns had begun. Hundreds of thousands of people were being ordered to leave their homes. Even Tokyo didn't feel safe. The imprint of that day left a deep collective trauma. In the months that followed, I was searching for a new place to live in Tokyo. My wife studied geological maps to see where the strongest bedrock was, on high ground away from any rivers. She obsessed over the age of buildings. She was clear: ""We're looking at nothing built before 1981."" Once we moved into our 1985 building, we began hoarding food and water. Crammed under the bathroom sink were boxes of pre-packaged cartons with a shelf life of five years. The dread and horror of 2011 would have returned on Monday. The death toll is nearing 50 and is likely to rise further. Roads have been ruptured and bridges destroyed. Hundreds of buildings have collapsed, trapping people underneath. The quake also unleashed massive landslides. But the vast majority of buildings are still standing. In the large cities of Toyama and Kanazawa, life this morning seemed to be returning to some kind normalcy. I spoke to a friend in the nearby city of Kashiwazaki. ""It was really terrifying,"" he said. ""By far the biggest I have ever experienced here. And we had to evacuate away from the coast. But we're back home now."" Despite the extensive damage, yesterday's quake is also a remarkable story of Japan's success at mitigating such disasters. Japan doesn't report earthquakes by magnitude. It reports how much the ground shakes. The scale goes from 1 to 7. And on Monday in Ishikawa the shaking hit the maximum, 7. The country's engineering triumph becomes clear when you compare the aftermath of Monday's disaster to the massive quake that hit Tokyo in 1923. The Great Kanto Quake, as it is known, flattened huge swathes of the city. Modern brick buildings constructed along European lines fell apart. The aftermath led to the drawing up of Japan's first quake-resistant building code. From then on new buildings would need to be reinforced with steel and concrete. Wooden buildings would have thicker beams. Each time the country has been hit by a large quake, the damage has been studied and the regulations updated. The biggest leap took place in 1981 after which all new buildings required seismic isolation measures. Again, after the Kobe quake in 1995, more lessons were learned. A measure of the success is that when the massive 9.0 quake hit in 2011, the shaking level in Tokyo hit 5. That is the same as the shaking that Japan's capital suffered in 1923. In 1923 the city was flattened - 140,000 people died. In 2011 huge skyscrapers swayed, windows shattered, but no major buildings fell. It was the tsunami that killed so many thousands, not the tremors on the ground. It is hard to think of any other country on Earth that could have experienced Monday's quake without being hit a lot worse.",what a century of earthquakes has taught japan by rupert wingfieldhayes bbc

correspondent It's been nearly 13 years since the devastating earthquake and tsunami that triggered an accident at a nuclear plant in Fukushima. But memories in Japan are still fresh. And on Monday, all of them will have been brought back in to focus as the shaking began in Ishikawa and the tsunami alarms began sounding. The warnings are not exactly unusual in Japan. When I first moved there, I would leap out of bed at the slightest shaking of our building. But within months, I was sleeping through the tremors. And in Japan, quakes quickly become a part of life. You get used to them, up to a point. There is still always that nagging feeling in the back of your mind. When will the next big one hit? Is our building good enough? For this generation all those fears were realised on 11 March, 2011. For two minutes the earth shook in a way no-one had experienced within living memory. It went on, and on, and on. Anyone who lived through it can recount exactly where they were and how terrified they felt. But worse was to come. Within 40 minutes, the first tsunamis were coming ashore, crashing over sea walls and sweeping away towns and villages for hundreds of kilometres along Japan's north-east coast, all carried on live TV by a news helicopter hovering over the city of Sendai. The following day brought even more terrible news - a nuclear power plant was in crisis. The Fukushima meltdowns had begun. Hundreds of thousands of people were being ordered to leave their homes. Even Tokyo didn't feel safe. The imprint of that day left a deep collective trauma. In the months that followed, I was searching for a new place to live in Tokyo. My wife studied geological maps to see where the strongest bedrock was, on high ground away from any rivers. She obsessed over the age of buildings. She was clear: ""We're looking at nothing built before 1981."" Once we moved into our 1985 building, we began hoarding food and water. Crammed under the bathroom sink were boxes of pre-packaged cartons with a shelf life of five years. The dread and horror of 2011 would have returned on Monday. The death toll is nearing 50 and is likely to rise further. Roads have been ruptured and bridges destroyed. Hundreds of buildings have collapsed, trapping people underneath. The quake also unleashed massive landslides. But the vast majority of buildings are still standing. In the large cities of Toyama and Kanazawa, life this morning seemed to be returning to some kind normalcy. I spoke to a friend in the nearby city of Kashiwazaki. ""It was really terrifying,"" he said. ""By far the biggest I have ever experienced here. And we had to evacuate away from the coast. But we're back home now."" Despite the extensive damage, yesterday's quake is also a remarkable story of Japan's success at mitigating such disasters. Japan doesn't report earthquakes by magnitude. It reports how much the ground shakes. The scale goes from 1 to 7. And on Monday in Ishikawa the shaking hit the maximum, 7. The country's engineering triumph becomes clear when you compare the aftermath of Monday's disaster to the massive quake that hit Tokyo in 1923. The Great Kanto Quake, as it is known, flattened huge swathes of the city. Modern brick buildings constructed along European lines fell apart. The aftermath led to the drawing up of Japan's first quake-resistant building code. From then on new buildings would need to be reinforced with steel and concrete. Wooden buildings would have thicker beams. Each time the country has been hit by a large quake, the damage has been studied and the regulations updated. The biggest leap took place in 1981 after which all new buildings required seismic isolation measures. Again, after the Kobe quake in 1995, more lessons were learned. A measure of the success is that when the massive 9.0 quake hit in 2011, the shaking level in Tokyo hit 5. That is the same as the shaking that Japan's capital suffered in 1923. In 1923 the city was flattened - 140,000 people died. In 2011 huge skyscrapers swayed, windows shattered, but no major buildings fell. It was the tsunami that killed so many thousands, not the tremors on the ground. It is hard to think of any other country on Earth that could have experienced Monday's quake without being hit a lot worse.","['What', 'a', 'century', 'of', 'earthquakes', 'has', 'taught', 'Japan',

7,BBC-Janpan4,2024/1/2,Jonathan Amos,How Japan’s powerful earthquakes have shifted the land,Asia,Japan,BBC NEWS,"How Japan’s powerful earthquakes have shifted the land By Jonathan Amos BBC News 2 January 2024 The power of the magnitude 7.5 quake in Japan can be seen in just how much the ground moved. It rose up by more than 4m (13ft) in places and moved sideways by over a metre. Earthquake-prone Japan is hugely advanced in monitoring what happens when the ground shakes. That's why it can make such precise measurements. There's a network of GPS stations dotted at strategic points right across the country. When an earthquake strikes, scientists can tell exactly how much each one has moved, showing how the landscape has buckled and shifted. This system shows that the land moved as much as 130cm to the west after the earthquake on Monday. Meanwhile, scientists have also been keeping an eye on Japan from space, comparing satellite images taken before and after the earthquake. On its latest pass, the ALOS-2 spacecraft reported that the distance between itself and the ground had shortened as the Earth's surface had risen up under the force of the tremor. The ground moved the most on the western side of the Noto peninsula. The ocean floor shifted off the coast there, generating tsunami waves of about 80cm in height. Fortuitously, the uplift may actually have lessened the impact of the waves when they arrived at the shoreline. Any death is one too many, but it is remarkable just how few have occurred, even as searches continue for those still trapped in the rubble. The loss and damage models have been predicting an eventual toll of, at most, a hundred or so. It's worth comparing this event with last year's M7.8 quake in Turkey. The two were broadly similar in terms of the energy released, but the death toll in Turkey and Syria rose to 50,000 and more. Go back to 2010 and the M7 quake in Haiti. More than 100,000 people died in that horrific event. The explanation of the difference is simple: preparedness. Japan sits at the confluence of four major tectonic plates. It is one of the most seismically active areas on Earth; the country accounts for about 20% of global quakes of Magnitude 6.0 or greater, with seismometers recording some kind of event every five minutes on average. Japan has therefore invested greatly in making its infrastructure and its population resilient. The building codes - the rules that guide construction - are strictly enforced; and citizens are well trained in how to respond to tremors. Japan also has one of the most advanced early warning systems in the world. Scientists cannot predict the timing and scale of an event, but once under way instruments will trigger notifications to TV, radio and cell networks. These warnings will arrive for some people distant from the epicentre perhaps 10 to 20 seconds before the onset of the most severe shaking. That might not sound like a lot of time, but it's sufficient notice to open the door at the local fire station, to apply the brakes on a high-speed train, and for everyone to ""drop, cover and hold on"".",how japans powerful earthquakes have shifted the land by jonathan amos bbc news  january  the power of the magnitude  quake in japan can be seen in just how much the ground moved it rose up by

The power of the magnitude 7.5 quake in Japan can be seen in just how much the ground moved. It rose up by more than 4m (13ft) in places and moved sideways by over a metre. Earthquake-prone Japan is hugely advanced in monitoring what happens when the ground shakes. That's why it can make such precise measurements. There's a network of GPS stations dotted at strategic points right across the country. When an earthquake strikes, scientists can tell exactly how much each one has moved, showing how the landscape has buckled and shifted. This system shows that the land moved as much as 130cm to the west after the earthquake on Monday. Meanwhile, scientists have also been keeping an eye on Japan from space, comparing satellite images taken before and after the earthquake. On its latest pass, the ALOS-2 spacecraft reported that the distance between itself and the ground had shortened as the Earth's surface had risen up under the force of the tremor. The ground moved the most on the western side of the Noto peninsula. The ocean floor shifted off the coast there, generating tsunami waves of about 80cm in height. Fortuitously, the uplift may actually have lessened the impact of the waves when they arrived at the shoreline. Any death is one too many, but it is remarkable just how few have occurred, even as searches continue for those still trapped in the rubble. The loss and damage models have been predicting an eventual toll of, at most, a hundred or so. It's worth comparing this event with last year's M7.8 quake in Turkey. The two were broadly similar in terms of the energy released, but the death toll in Turkey and Syria rose to 50,000 and more. Go back to 2010 and the M7 quake in Haiti. More than 100,000 people died in that horrific event. The explanation of the difference is simple: preparedness. Japan sits at the confluence of four major tectonic plates. It is one of the most seismically active areas on Earth; the country accounts for about 20% of global quakes of Magnitude 6.0 or greater, with seismometers recording some kind of event every five minutes on average. Japan has therefore invested greatly in making its infrastructure and its population resilient. The building codes - the rules that guide construction - are strictly enforced; and citizens are well trained in how to respond to tremors. Japan also has one of the most advanced early warning systems in the world. Scientists cannot predict the timing and scale of an event, but once under way instruments will trigger notifications to TV, radio and cell networks. These warnings will arrive for some people distant from the epicentre perhaps 10 to 20 seconds before the onset of the most severe shaking. That might not sound like a lot of time, but it's sufficient notice to open the door at the local fire station, to apply the brakes on a high-speed train, and for everyone to ""drop, cover and hold on"".","['How', 'Japan', '’s', 'powerful', 'earthquakes', 'have', 'shifted', 'the', 'land', 'By', 'Jonathan', 'Amos', 'BBC', 'News', '2', 'January', '2024', 'The', 'power', 'of', 'the', 'magnitude',

8,BBC-Janpan5,2024/1/3,UNKNOWN,Japan earthquake: Fires hit quake zone as rescuers race to reach survivors,Asia,Japan,BBC NEWS,"Japan earthquake: Fires hit quake zone as rescuers race to reach survivors BBC News 3 January 2024 Rescue efforts continue in Japan after at least 64 people were killed in a powerful earthquake that hit the country on New Year's Day. Homes collapsed, buildings caught fire and roads were extensively damaged, hindering the work of rescue services. The epicentre of the 7.6 quake was the Noto peninsula, in central Japan. The Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, said that emergency services were locked in a ""race against time"" to rescue survivors. ""More than 40 hours have passed since the disaster. We have received a lot of information about people in need of rescue and there are people waiting for help,"" Mr Kishida said Wednesday after an emergency task force meeting. He also said some 3,000 rescuers were trying to reach parts of the Noto peninsula. Helicopter surveys showed many fires and widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The city of Wajima, on the northern tip of Noto, has been cut off from land routes. In the coastal city of Suzu in Ishikawa prefecture, some 90% of homes in the city had been ""completely or nearly completely destroyed"", mayor Masushiro Izumiya told news outlet Kyodo. The Japanese military has been handing out supplies including food, water and blankets for those who have had to vacate their homes. The country's government has said that 57,360 people had to be evacuated. Tens of thousands of meals are being delivered across the affected region. Aftershocks continued into Wednesday. The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, warned people to ""be alert"" for more earthquakes ""of an intensity of up to 7"" in the coming week. Ishikawa, 155km (96.3 miles) south of the Noto peninsula, experienced a 5.5 quake on Wednesday morning. The major tsunami warnings put out by the Japanese government on Monday were later downgraded. By Tuesday, all tsunami advisories were lifted along the Sea of Japan, meaning there was no longer a risk of giant waves. Residents of the affected area of Japan have been sharing their experiences of the quake, which lasted several minutes. An 82-year-old resident of Nanao, Toshio Iwahama, told the BBC that his wooden home had partially collapsed. He said that despite living through multiple earthquakes, he had never experienced tremors of this magnitude. Briton Emma Ward, 41, who was on a skiing holiday in the resort village of Hakuba, said the quake had hit ""without warning"", prompting her group to take shelter under a table in a cafe. She told the BBC that the intensity of the tremors had caused people to flee the building entirely. ""The worst part during the earthquake was not knowing how intense it was going to become. It's a very frightening experience,"" Ms Ward said. Many also said the quake had reminded them of the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed 18,000 people and triggered an accident at a nuclear plant in Fukushima. In an incident unrelated to the earthquake, a Japan Airlines plane caught fire on Tuesday as it collided with a coastguard aircraft on its way to provide earthquake relief at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Five people on board the coastguard plane are known to have died, but the Japan Airlines plane's 379 passengers and crew managed to escape. Japan is one of the most seismically active nations on Earth, owing to its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where many tectonic plates meet.

9,BBC-Janpan6,2024/1/4,Jean Mackenzie,Japan earthquake: Eerie search for bodies near epicentre,Asia,Japan,BBC NEWS,"Japan earthquake: Eerie search for bodies near epicentre By Jean Mackenzie BBC News 4 January 2024 The fishing town of Wajima on Japan's west coast is burnt and broken. At its centre, the remnants of its old marketplace are still smouldering, as if an explosion had just erupted, wiping out an area the size of a football pitch. A fire broke out when the New Year's Day earthquake hit, and spread instantly, incinerating the wooden stalls and some surrounding homes. Twisted fragments of corrugated iron are scattered among the ash. Firefighters are still combing the smoking debris, checking for unextinguished flames. Throughout the town, people's traditional wooden homes lie splintered on the ground, collapsed; not made to withstand Japan's endless earthquakes. It has taken us two days to get this close to the epicentre of the earthquake, the country's most powerful in 12 years. We have lost count of how many times we were forced to turn around because the roads had been so severely severed. This has hampered the rescue efforts. The search team with sniffer dogs arrived in Wajima just hours before us. They spent the afternoon searching the collapsed homes, one at a time, not knowing whether there were people inside each house or not, let alone whether there were survivors. A lack of information is slowing down their ability to find people. One of the residents, Keiko Kato, ran to greet the rescue workers. Her husband's relatives were trapped inside one of the houses, she believed - his 95-year-old aunt, her niece and her daughter. She had not heard from them since the quake, and had already searched most of the evacuation centres in vain. But the house was so destroyed, the dog could not go deep enough in, and the team had to move on. ""At least it didn't find a body,"" she said, adding: ""There's still hope."" Another resident arrived, pleading with the workers to check his family's house next. Wajima now resembles a ghost town. Most heeded the early warnings to evacuate, when tsunamis were forecast, and now their homes are too damaged or unsafe to return to. Devoid of people, car and house alarms, crushed and activated by the quake, provide some of the only sound here. Though at the end of one street, a surviving vending machine plays eerily upbeat jingles on repeat. At least 77 people are now known to have died in the quake. Wajima has the largest death toll so far, with more than three dozen confirmed fatalities, but that number is expected to rise. Some parts of the town are still cut off by ruptured roads and landslides, with help unable to reach people. Other areas on the remote Noto Peninsula on Japan's west coast, where the quake struck, are also isolated. Further north, the town of Suzu is inaccessible by road, and the scale of the destruction is unclear. According to the town's mayor, Masuhiro Izumiya, almost none of its houses are standing. Around 90% are completely or almost completely collapsed, he said. A small tsunami struck the city one minute after the quake. Food and aid are arriving by boat, but local officials told us they were having to go door-to-door to check for survivors. More than 30,000 people are still in shelters, with some towns lacking water, electricity and internet connection. One woman, sheltering at the evacuation centre in Wajima with her injured husband, told us that even at the centre there was not enough food and water, and the queues at the only open shop snaked down the road. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced plans to multiply the number of military and rescue personal providing relief. He has admitted that rescue efforts have been hindered by the extreme damage to the roads. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing around the Noto Peninsula since the end of 2020. There have been more than 500 small and medium earthquakes here over the past three years. This had bred a false sense of security, among some who live here. ""We always have earthquakes here, but I just didn't think we'd get a big one like this,"" said Toshio Iwahama, whose home was badly damaged. ""I didn't take it seriously. I thought we were safe."" At 82 years old, and recently widowed, he is worried about how he will pay for repairs. Now it is the aftershocks that concern him. There have been more than 200 tremors since the earthquake struck on Monday. Warning alarms screech out of mobile phones just before the ground shakes, forcing people in and out of their homes. Some are apprehensive to retreat indoors, to shelter from the cold and rain. But it is the memory of major past earthquakes which has reignited people's trauma, especially of the enormous quake and tsunami of 2011 that triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster and killed nearly 20,000 people. Japan has made itself more resilient to earthquakes and tsunamis over the years, and so have its people. Houses, roads and nuclear power plants are safer, while residents are more alert and prepared to respond. But Monday's earthquake has shown these tremors have the power to surprise and devastate the country. It has shattered people's hope here on the Noto Peninsula that they would be spared a ""big one"", leaving some fearful of what could come next. Toshio Iwahama knows now he is at the mercy of the Earth, and his unfortunately placed home on top of the Pacific Rim of Fire.",japan earthquake eerie search for bodies near epicentre by jean

But the house was so destroyed, the dog could not go deep enough in, and the team had to move on. ""At least it didn't find a body,"" she said, adding: ""There's still hope."" Another resident arrived, pleading with the workers to check his family's house next. Wajima now resembles a ghost town. Most heeded the early warnings to evacuate, when tsunamis were forecast, and now their homes are too damaged or unsafe to return to. Devoid of people, car and house alarms, crushed and activated by the quake, provide some of the only sound here. Though at the end of one street, a surviving vending machine plays eerily upbeat jingles on repeat. At least 77 people are now known to have died in the quake. Wajima has the largest death toll so far, with more than three dozen confirmed fatalities, but that number is expected to rise. Some parts of the town are still cut off by ruptured roads and landslides, with help unable to reach people. Other areas on the remote Noto Peninsula on Japan's west coast, where the quake struck, are also isolated. Further north, the town of Suzu is inaccessible by road, and the scale of the destruction is unclear. According to the town's mayor, Masuhiro Izumiya, almost none of its houses are standing. Around 90% are completely or almost completely collapsed, he said. A small tsunami struck the city one minute after the quake. Food and aid are arriving by boat, but local officials told us they were having to go door-to-door to check for survivors. More than 30,000 people are still in shelters, with some towns lacking water, electricity and internet connection. One woman, sheltering at the evacuation centre in Wajima with her injured husband, told us that even at the centre there was not enough food and water, and the queues at the only open shop snaked down the road. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced plans to multiply the number of military and rescue personal providing relief. He has admitted that rescue efforts have been hindered by the extreme damage to the roads. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing around the Noto Peninsula since the end of 2020. There have been more than 500 small and medium earthquakes here over the past three years. This had bred a false sense of security, among some who live here. ""We always have earthquakes here, but I just didn't think we'd get a big one like this,"" said Toshio Iwahama, whose home was badly damaged. ""I didn't take it seriously. I thought we were safe."" At 82 years old, and recently widowed, he is worried about how he will pay for repairs. Now it is the aftershocks that concern him. There have been more than 200 tremors since the earthquake struck on Monday. Warning alarms screech out of mobile phones just before the ground shakes, forcing people in and out of their homes. Some are apprehensive to retreat indoors, to shelter from the cold and rain. But it is the memory of major past earthquakes which has reignited people's trauma, especially of the enormous quake and tsunami of 2011 that triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster and killed nearly 20,000 people. Japan has made itself more resilient to earthquakes and tsunamis over the years, and so have its people. Houses, roads and nuclear power plants are safer, while residents are more alert and prepared to respond. But Monday's earthquake has shown these tremors have the power to surprise and devastate the country. It has shattered people's hope here on the Noto Peninsula that they would be spared a ""big one"", leaving some fearful of what could come next. Toshio Iwahama knows now he is at the mercy of the Earth, and his unfortunately placed home on top of the Pacific Rim of Fire.","['Japan', 'earthquake', ':', 'Eerie', 'search', 'for', 'bodies',

10,BBC-Janpan7,2024/1/4,Jean Mackenzie & Kelly Ng,Japan earthquake: Woman in her 80s found as critical 72-hour window closes,Asia,Japan,BBC NEWS,"Japan earthquake: Woman in her 80s found as critical 72-hour window closes By Jean Mackenzie & Kelly Ng BBC News 4 January 2024 A woman in her 80s has been pulled from the rubble of her collapsed house in Japan, 72 hours after the New Year's Day earthquake. Public broadcaster NHK showed video of the woman being lifted out of her home in the town of Wajima. Rescuers are racing against time in their search for survivors, as a critical three-day window has now shut. At least 82 people were killed when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the remote Noto peninsula on Monday. Many people are thought to be trapped under their collapsed homes - mostly in the towns of Suzu and Wajima. The woman in her 80s had reportedly been trapped on the ground floor of her house since the earthquake hit. After 72 hours, the chances of finding people alive drops substantially. That window has now closed as the earthquake hit at 16:10 local time (07:10 GMT) on Monday. Tens of thousands of residents are still without power and water, while hundreds remain isolated from help due to landslides and blocked roads. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said earlier on Thursday that 150 people had been rescued so far, and that rescuers would continue with their full-scale efforts to save as many as possible. ""This is a very difficult situation. But from the viewpoint of protecting lives, I ask that you make every effort to save and rescue as many lives as possible by this evening, when the critical 72 hours of the disaster will have passed,"" he said. The tremor on Monday, which was followed by a series of aftershocks, injured at least 330 people, according to AFP news agency. More than 30,000 people in the quake-affected areas are still in shelters, with some towns lacking water, electricity and internet connection. Meanwhile stories of dramatic rescues have been going viral online. A video posted by Peace Winds Japan, a local NGO that helped with the rescue, show several rescuers ploughing through layers of collapsed furniture to rescue a woman trapped under her home. They then wrapped a thick blanket around her. The BBC saw extensive destruction on a visit to Wajima on Wednesday, where some homes and vehicles were crushed under crumbling concrete. Many of the town's old, traditional wooden homes had collapsed. Japan introduced new regulations to protect buildings from earthquakes in 1981, but many of the wooden homes were built before these were introduced. Some of the Wajima's residents, many of them elderly, had not carried out the work to upgrade their homes. Data from 2018 showed that more than half the buildings in the town were not in line with the new standards. With a population of about 23,000, Wajima now resembles a ghost town as most heeded the early warnings to evacuate, when tsunamis were forecast. But it has still recorded the largest death toll, with 48 confirmed deaths - more than half of the total number of casualties. That number is expected to rise, as some areas surrounding the town are still cut off by ruptured roads and landslides, with help unable to reach people. Shigeru Sakaguchi, mayor of Wajima, said food and other aid supplies had reached only 2,000 out of 10,000 evacuees from the town so far. According to the mayor of Suzu, a town with a population of about 13,000, almost none of its houses are standing. Around 90% are completely or almost completely collapsed, Masuhiro Izumiya said. A small tsunami struck the town one minute after the major quake. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing around Noto since the end of 2020. There have been more than 500 small and medium earthquakes here over the past three years.",japan earthquake woman in her s found as critical hour window closes by jean mackenzie  kelly ng bbc news

By Jean Mackenzie & Kelly Ng BBC News 4 January 2024 A woman in her 80s has been pulled from the rubble of her collapsed house in Japan, 72 hours after the New Year's Day earthquake. Public broadcaster NHK showed video of the woman being lifted out of her home in the town of Wajima. Rescuers are racing against time in their search for survivors, as a critical three-day window has now shut. At least 82 people were killed when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the remote Noto peninsula on Monday. Many people are thought to be trapped under their collapsed homes - mostly in the towns of Suzu and Wajima. The woman in her 80s had reportedly been trapped on the ground floor of her house since the earthquake hit. After 72 hours, the chances of finding people alive drops substantially. That window has now closed as the earthquake hit at 16:10 local time (07:10 GMT) on Monday. Tens of thousands of residents are still without power and water, while hundreds remain isolated from help due to landslides and blocked roads. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said earlier on Thursday that 150 people had been rescued so far, and that rescuers would continue with their full-scale efforts to save as many as possible. ""This is a very difficult situation. But from the viewpoint of protecting lives, I ask that you make every effort to save and rescue as many lives as possible by this evening, when the critical 72 hours of the disaster will have passed,"" he said. The tremor on Monday, which was followed by a series of aftershocks, injured at least 330 people, according to AFP news agency. More than 30,000 people in the quake-affected areas are still in shelters, with some towns lacking water, electricity and internet connection. Meanwhile stories of dramatic rescues have been going viral online. A video posted by Peace Winds Japan, a local NGO that helped with the rescue, show several rescuers ploughing through layers of collapsed furniture to rescue a woman trapped under her home. They then wrapped a thick blanket around her. The BBC saw extensive destruction on a visit to Wajima on Wednesday, where some homes and vehicles were crushed under crumbling concrete. Many of the town's old, traditional wooden homes had collapsed. Japan introduced new regulations to protect buildings from earthquakes in 1981, but many of the wooden homes were built before these were introduced. Some of the Wajima's residents, many of them elderly, had not carried out the work to upgrade their homes. Data from 2018 showed that more than half the buildings in the town were not in line with the new standards. With a population of about 23,000, Wajima now resembles a ghost town as most heeded the early warnings to evacuate, when tsunamis were forecast. But it has still recorded the largest death toll, with 48 confirmed deaths - more than half of the total number of casualties. That number is expected to rise, as some areas surrounding the town are still cut off by ruptured roads and landslides, with help unable to reach people. Shigeru Sakaguchi, mayor of Wajima, said food and other aid supplies had reached only 2,000 out of 10,000 evacuees from the town so far. According to the mayor of Suzu, a town with a population of about 13,000, almost none of its houses are standing. Around 90% are completely or almost completely collapsed, Masuhiro Izumiya said. A small tsunami struck the town one minute after the major quake. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing around Noto since the end of 2020. There have been more than 500 small and medium earthquakes here over the past three years.","['Japan', 'earthquake', ':', 'Woman', 'in', 'her', '80s', 'found', 'as', 'critical', '72', '-', 'hour',

A critical 72-hour period to find survivors from when the quake struck ended late on Thursday. On Friday, the death toll from the 7.6 magnitude earthquake in the remote Noto peninsula rose to 92. Japan's Self-Defense Forces doubled the number of troops taking part in rescue and relief to 4,600, Kyodo news agency reported. Many people are thought to be trapped under their collapsed homes - mostly in the towns of Suzu and Wajima. The wooden structures were not built to withstand powerful earthquakes that frequently plague the country. Tens of thousands of residents are still without power and water, while hundreds remain isolated from help because of landslides and blocked roads. ""We will not give up,"" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said after a meeting with disaster response officials on Friday. Mr Kishida urged rescue and relief workers to leave no stone unturned in reaching the affected communities. ""The biggest challenge for us is the access. Most disastrous areas are difficult to reach because of the rocks on the roads and landslides caused by the rain and the aftershocks,"" said Musubi Yata from the Japanese Red Cross Society. ""When there were aftershocks, we had to stop and leave some medical activities because the roads may collapse,"" she told the BBC. The earthquake on Monday evening also triggered a small tsunami that flooded at least 296 acres (120 ha) of land, according to Japan's land ministry. Japan had said it would spend 4.74 billion yen ($34m; £27m) in budget reserves to assist the victims. Photos posted by the Japan Ground Self Defense Force showed troops loading food, drinking water and toiletries on to trucks that were lined up on the road. Troops can also be seen clearing mud and debris from landslide-hit roads. In another photo, troops were shown carrying a survivor on a stretcher over a snow-covered trail. The BBC saw extensive destruction on a visit to Wajima on Wednesday, where some homes and vehicles were crushed under crumbling concrete.

12,BBC-Janpan9,2024/1/6, Vicky Wong,Japan earthquake: Woman in 90s found alive under rubble five days later,Asia,Japan,BBC NEWS,"Japan earthquake: Woman in 90s found alive under rubble five days later By Vicky Wong BBC News 6 January 2024 A woman in her 90s has been found alive under rubble five days after a devastating earthquake struck central Japan. Rescue workers discovered her in the wreckage of a two-storey building in the town of Suzu. The 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Japan Sea coast on Monday, flattening towns on the remote Noto peninsula. More than 120 people have been confirmed dead, and 200 are missing. According to the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, 100 rescuers were sent to the town of Suzu after learning that two women were buried alive. Citing local police sources, the newspaper reported that the elderly woman was responsive, but believed to be suffering from hypothermia. At the same site, rescuers also found a woman in her 40s in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest, reports said. The first 72 hours of a rescue operation are considered critical because after that, the chances of finding people alive drops substantially. The two women were found days after that window closed. Japan's Self-Defense Forces are using helicopters for rescue operations and deliver supplies to isolated areas, as several roads remain blocked. According to public broadcaster NHK, rescue efforts could be hampered by wet weather forecasted for Sunday in some quake-hit areas, with authorities warning that even a small amount of rain could trigger more landslides. They also warned that a cold front is expected on Sunday, which could bring snowfall through Monday in mountainous areas of the quake-hit Ishikawa prefecture. More than 30,000 people are being housed in government shelters. As of Saturday, around 23,200 households were without electricity in Ishikawa and more than 66,400 lacked running water. Ishikawa's governor Hiroshi Hase said during a disaster management meeting that the prefecture was facing ""extremely severe situations"". He also warned that restoring running water would take a long time ""as many water pipes have cracks"". Some hospitals and facilities for taking care of elderly and disabled people have also lost power and water. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing around Noto since the end of 2020.

13,BBC-Janpan10,2024/1/6,Mariko Oi,Japan earthquake: The tiny firm that alerts millions about disasters,Business,Japan,BBC NEWS,"Japan earthquake: The tiny firm that alerts millions about disasters By Mariko Oi BBC News 6 January 2024 When a 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit Japan's remote Noto peninsula on New Year's Day, millions of people were alerted by a small company that has been punching above its weight for years now. NERV is run by a small private firm called Gehirn - meaning brain in German - with just 13 full-time staff. Still, its warnings of Japan's frequent earthquakes are often faster than those issued by official bodies and the country's public broadcaster, NHK. NERV's Japanese-language account on X (formerly Twitter) has 2.2 million followers while another 35,000 people use it in English. Its app, which was launched in September 2019, has been downloaded more than four million times from both the Apple Store and Google Play. It was created in 2010 as an account by then 19-year-old Daiki Ishimori. X is huge in Japan and is the go-to social media platform for disaster information in the country - especially since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. As well as offering real-time information on earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions NERV also provides updates on extreme weather events like typhoons, flooding and heavy snow. The account collates and tweets out data from a number of agencies that track natural disasters - often releasing information faster than even they do. Mr Ishimori said NERV is heavily influenced by hit anime TV show Neon Genesis Evangelion, which is set in a post-apocalyptic world after half of the human population has been wiped out. The account's name ""special service agency NERV"" is a nod to an organisation in the show that issues alerts about threats to humankind. ""I created NERV as a parody account because Twitter was getting popular at the time,"" Mr Ishimori tells the BBC. ""It started as my programming hobby to post automated tweets about weather alerts using the Japan Meteorological Agency data."" At the time, the account only had around 300 followers. But then in 2011, Japan's most powerful earthquake on record struck. Best known for triggering a tsunami that caused a nuclear accident in Fukushima, the quake also caused great loss of life in his hometown Ishinomaki in Miyagi in the north-east of the country. For four days, Mr Ishimori was unable to contact his family. ""To be honest, I thought they must be dead,"" he recalls. He later found out that while his immediate family was safe, one of his aunts had died. ""I realised we needed to have other ways - not just TV and radio - to communicate disaster information,"" he says, as TV became useless during power cuts. He started posting about earthquakes, and as Japan experienced more natural disasters, the account added hundreds of thousands of new followers. However, recent changes to X had an impact on NERV during the New Year's Day earthquake. Last year, X started charging users to access its application programming interface (API), which links X to external systems and enables automated posts on the platform. The platform's API was previously free to use, but now only allows up to 1,500 free automated posts a month. Gehirn subscribes to a basic plan, which allows 100 posts a day for $100 (£79) a month. When it sent out earthquake and tsunami alerts on Monday, NERV said it appeared to have hit this cap and encouraged its followers to download its app. Several hours later, it said that X had registered its accounts - both in Japanese and English - as ""public utility"", which resolved the issue. But NERV had already started shifting away from the platform in 2019 when its account was locked for several hours during an earthquake. ""If we are on other people's platforms, their rules can suddenly change so we want to focus on our own platform,"" Mr Ishimori says. He says his mission has always been to ""make Japan safer"" - not make money, adding he aims to make the NERV app as accessible as possible, including for those with disabilities. However, Mr Ishimori acknowledges that as the app grows his company needs to bring in money. The firm started a paid membership scheme called the ""supporters' club"" in 2020 to cover its costs, which currently stands at around 120 million yen ($829,200; £653,172) a year. ""We are still far from making money,"" says Mr Ishimori, adding that about a third of its running costs are funded by supporters. ""The more funding we get, the more new information we buy so that is why we are still in the red,"" he laughs. Mr Ishimori says he continues to be driven by the guilt of not being able to help his aunt in 2011. ""We know that there will be another big earthquake and big tsunami. My mission is to solve the accessibility of our disaster information by then.""",japan earthquake the tiny firm that alerts millions about disasters by mariko oi bbc news  january  when a  magnitude

remote Noto peninsula on New Year's Day, millions of people were alerted by a small company that has been punching above its weight for years now. NERV is run by a small private firm called Gehirn - meaning brain in German - with just 13 full-time staff. Still, its warnings of Japan's frequent earthquakes are often faster than those issued by official bodies and the country's public broadcaster, NHK. NERV's Japanese-language account on X (formerly Twitter) has 2.2 million followers while another 35,000 people use it in English. Its app, which was launched in September 2019, has been downloaded more than four million times from both the Apple Store and Google Play. It was created in 2010 as an account by then 19-year-old Daiki Ishimori. X is huge in Japan and is the go-to social media platform for disaster information in the country - especially since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. As well as offering real-time information on earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions NERV also provides updates on extreme weather events like typhoons, flooding and heavy snow. The account collates and tweets out data from a number of agencies that track natural disasters - often releasing information faster than even they do. Mr Ishimori said NERV is heavily influenced by hit anime TV show Neon Genesis Evangelion, which is set in a post-apocalyptic world after half of the human population has been wiped out. The account's name ""special service agency NERV"" is a nod to an organisation in the show that issues alerts about threats to humankind. ""I created NERV as a parody account because Twitter was getting popular at the time,"" Mr Ishimori tells the BBC. ""It started as my programming hobby to post automated tweets about weather alerts using the Japan Meteorological Agency data."" At the time, the account only had around 300 followers. But then in 2011, Japan's most powerful earthquake on record struck. Best known for triggering a tsunami that caused a nuclear accident in Fukushima, the quake also caused great loss of life in his hometown Ishinomaki in Miyagi in the north-east of the country. For four days, Mr Ishimori was unable to contact his family. ""To be honest, I thought they must be dead,"" he recalls. He later found out that while his immediate family was safe, one of his aunts had died. ""I realised we needed to have other ways - not just TV and radio - to communicate disaster information,"" he says, as TV became useless during power cuts. He started posting about earthquakes, and as Japan experienced more natural disasters, the account added hundreds of thousands of new followers. However, recent changes to X had an impact on NERV during the New Year's Day earthquake. Last year, X started charging users to access its application programming interface (API), which links X to external systems and enables automated posts on the platform. The platform's API was previously free to use, but now only allows up to 1,500 free automated posts a month. Gehirn subscribes to a basic plan, which allows 100 posts a day for $100 (£79) a month. When it sent out earthquake and tsunami alerts on Monday, NERV said it appeared to have hit this cap and encouraged its followers to download its app. Several hours later, it said that X had registered its accounts - both in Japanese and English - as ""public utility"", which resolved the issue. But NERV had already started shifting away from the platform in 2019 when its account was locked for several hours during an earthquake. ""If we are on other people's platforms, their rules can suddenly change so we want to focus on our own platform,"" Mr Ishimori says. He says his mission has always been to ""make Japan safer"" - not make money, adding he aims to make the NERV app as accessible as possible, including for those with disabilities. However, Mr Ishimori acknowledges that as the app grows his company needs to bring in money. The firm started a paid membership scheme called the ""supporters' club"" in 2020 to cover its costs, which currently stands at around 120 million yen ($829,200; £653,172) a year. ""We are still far from making money,"" says Mr Ishimori, adding that about a third of its running costs are funded by supporters. ""The more funding we get, the more new information we buy so that is why we are still in the red,"" he laughs. Mr Ishimori says he continues to be driven by the guilt of not being able to help his aunt in 2011. ""We know that there will be another big earthquake and big tsunami. My mission is to solve the accessibility of our disaster information by then.""","['Japan', 'earthquake', ':', 'The', 'tiny', 'firm', 'that', 'alerts', 'millions', 'about', 'disasters', 'By',

Efforts are continuing to find more than 100 people who remain missing a week later. But bad weather is hampering rescuers- with heavy rain and snow triggering warnings of landslides and building collapses. The 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the remote Noto peninsula - toppling buildings and sparking a major fire. The majority of the deaths have happened in the hard-hit cities of Wajima and Suzu. Meanwhile, the number of people missing has dropped from 195 to just over 100. The death toll has jumped from the 120 reported on Sunday. More than 2,000 people are reportedly still cut off due to massive damage to roads. Several others are living in emergency shelters. The Japanese military has been handing out supplies including food, water and blankets for those who have had to vacate their homes. The defence ministry said in a statement on Sunday that it had sent nearly 6,000 troops out to help with the relief mission. They added that they believe there are still people alive who need rescue and vowed to continue their lifesaving operations despite the ending of a critical 72 hour window to find survivors. Stories of miraculous recoveries have been emerging. A woman in her 90s was found alive under rubble five days in Suzu. Those in the worst-affected areas are being urged to keep their guard up as they continue to experience further quakes. As of early Monday local time, more than 1,200 tremors had been recorded since New Year's Day, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reports. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing around Noto since the end of 2020.

Japan's devastating New Year's Day earthquake has risen from to more than 160, authorities say. Efforts are continuing to find more than 100 people who remain missing a week later. But bad weather is hampering rescuers- with heavy rain and snow triggering warnings of landslides and building collapses. The 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the remote Noto peninsula - toppling buildings and sparking a major fire. The majority of the deaths have happened in the hard-hit cities of Wajima and Suzu. Meanwhile, the number of people missing has dropped from 195 to just over 100. The death toll has jumped from the 120 reported on Sunday. More than 2,000 people are reportedly still cut off due to massive damage to roads. Several others are living in emergency shelters. The Japanese military has been handing out supplies including food, water and blankets for those who have had to vacate their homes. The defence ministry said in a statement on Sunday that it had sent nearly 6,000 troops out to help with the relief mission. They added that they believe there are still people alive who need rescue and vowed to continue their lifesaving operations despite the ending of a critical 72 hour window to find survivors. Stories of miraculous recoveries have been emerging. A woman in her 90s was found alive under rubble five days in Suzu. Those in the worst-affected areas are being urged to keep their guard up as they continue to experience further quakes. As of early Monday local time, more than 1,200 tremors had been recorded since New Year's Day, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reports. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing around Noto since the end of 2020. More than 500 small and medium earthquakes have hit there over the past three years.","['Japan', 'earthquake', 'death', 'toll', 'rises', 'to', '161', 'By', 'Kathryn', 'Armstrong', 'BBC', 'News', '8', 'January', '2024', 'The', 'death', 'toll', 'from', 'Japan', ""'s"", 'devastating', 'New', 'Year', ""'s"", 'Day', 'earthquake', 'has', 'risen', 'from', 'to', 'more', 'than', '160', ',', 'authorities', 'say', '.', 'Efforts', 'are', 'continuing', 'to', 'find', 'more', 'than', '100', 'people', 'who', 'remain', 'missing', 'a', 'week', 'later', '.', 'But', 'bad', 'weather', 'is', 'hampering', 'rescuers-', 'with', 'heavy', 'rain', 'and', 'snow', 'triggering', 'warnings', 'of', 'landslides', 'and', 'building', 'collapses', '.', 'The', '7.6', 'magnitude', 'earthquake', 'struck', 'the', 'remote', 'Noto', 'peninsula', '-', 'toppling', 'buildings', 'and', 'sparking', 'a', 'major', 'fire', '.', 'The', 'majority', 'of', 'the', 'deaths', 'have', 'happened', 'in', 'the', 'hard', '-', 'hit', 'cities', 'of', 'Wajima', 'and', 'Suzu', '.', 'Meanwhile', ',', 'the', 'number', 'of', 'people', 'missing', 'has', 'dropped', 'from', '195', 'to', 'just', 'over', '100', '.', 'The', 'death', 'toll', 'has', 'jumped', 'from', 'the', '120', 'reported', 'on', 'Sunday', '.', 'More', 'than', '2,000', 'people', 'are', 'reportedly', 'still', 'cut', 'off', 'due', 'to', 'massive', 'damage', 'to', 'roads', '.', 'Several', 'others', 'are', 'living', 'in', 'emergency', 'shelters', '.', 'The', 'Japanese', 'military', 'has', 'been', 'handing', 'out', 'supplies', 'including', 'food', ',', 'water', 'and', 'blankets', 'for', 'those', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'to', 'vacate', 'their', 'homes', '.', 'The', 'defence', 'ministry', 'said', 'in', 'a', 'statement', 'on', 'Sunday', 'that', 'it', 'had', 'sent', 'nearly', '6,000', 'troops', 'out', 'to', 'help', 'with', 'the', 'relief', 'mission', '.', 'They', 'added', 'that', 'they', 'believe', 'there', 'are', 'still', 'people', 'alive', 'who', 'need', 'rescue', 'and', 'vowed', 'to', 'continue', 'their', 'lifesaving', 'operations', 'despite', 'the', 'ending', 'of', 'a', 'critical', '72', 'hour', 'window', 'to', 'find', 'survivors', '.', 'Stories', 'of', 'miraculous', 'recoveries', 'have', 'been', 'emerging', '.', 'A', 'woman', 'in', 'her', '90s', 'was', 'found', 'alive', 'under', 'rubble', 'five', 'days', 'in', 'Suzu', '.', 'Those', 'in', 'the', 'worst', '-', 'affected', 'areas', 'are', 'being', 'urged', 'to', 'keep', 'their', 'guard', 'up', 'as', 'they', 'continue', 'to', 'experience', 'further', 'quakes', '.', 'As', 'of', 'early', 'Monday', 'local', 'time', ',', 'more', 'than', '1,200', 'tremors', 'had', 'been', 'recorded', 'since', 'New', 'Year', ""'s"", 'Day', ',', 'Japanese', 'public', 'broadcaster', 'NHK', 'reports', '.', 'Japan', 'is', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'most', 'seismically', 'active', 'countries', 'in', 'the', 'world', ',', 'and', 'activity', 'has', 'been', 'increasing', 'around', 'Noto', 'since', 'the', 'end', 'of', '2020', '.', 'More', 'than', '500', 'small', 'and', 'medium', 'earthquakes', 'have', 'hit', 'there', 'over', 'the', 'past', 'three', 'years', '.']","[('Japan', 'GPE'), ('161', 'CARDINAL'), ('Kathryn Armstrong', 'PERSON'), ('BBC News', 'ORG'), ('8 January 2024', 'DATE'), ('Japan', 'GPE'), (""New Year's Day"", 'EVENT'), ('more than 160', 'CARDINAL'), ('more than 100', 'CARDINAL'), ('a week later', 'DATE'), ('7.6', 'CARDINAL'), ('Noto', 'ORG'), ('Wajima', 'LOC'), ('195', 'CARDINAL'), ('just over 100', 'CARDINAL'), ('120', 'CARDINAL'), ('Sunday', 'DATE'), ('More than 2,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('Japanese', 'NORP'), ('Sunday', 'DATE'), ('nearly 6,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('72 hour', 'TIME'), ('90s', 'DATE'), ('five days', 'DATE'), ('Suzu', 'GPE'), ('early Monday', 'DATE'), ('more than 1,200', 'CARDINAL'), (""New Year's Day"", 'EVENT'), ('Japanese', 'NORP'), ('NHK', 'ORG'), ('Japan', 'GPE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Noto', 'ORG'), ('the end of 2020', 'DATE'), ('More than 500', 'CARDINAL'), ('the past three years', 'DATE')]","{'neg': 0.125, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': -0.9639}",150
