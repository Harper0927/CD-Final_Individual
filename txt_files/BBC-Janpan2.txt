A powerful earthquake has struck Japan, causing large waves and damage to buildings.
The 7.6-magnitude quake took place in Noto province on Honshu island, with officials urging people in coastal areas to move to higher ground.
Although the full extent of the damage is still unknown, dozens of buildings have collapsed in several towns, trapping a number of people under the rubble.
Thousands of people are spending the night in evacuation centres, as the Japanese military have been handing out food, water and blankets to those forced to leave their homes.
A major tsunami warning was issued, but was later downgraded to a warning, and then an "advisory".
